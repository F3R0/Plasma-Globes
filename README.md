-------------------------------

There are 4 different shaders available in this file. One of them is a dynamic plasma globe with arcs which are rotating towards an object named "TOUCH". A fireball appears when there is a collision between the "Touch" object and the globe.

Limitations:
    
- Eevee only.
- Emission cannot be baked.
- Poor reflections with single
  colored backgrounds.
- Animation preview is not
  accurate.

I have used in the preview
renders can be downloaded from:
